# Mental-Health-Care
Mental Health Care was my Final Year Project (UG @Fast, 2017). It was created as an android app and the aim was to examine and help in curing commmon mental illnesses emerging in Pakistan, specially among youth (Depression, Anxiety and Bipolar Disorder).

## Basic Requirements
1. Standard Questionnaire
2. Progress Tracking
3. Exercises (in form of Audio, Animation and Videos)
4. Forum (to aid as a group therapy)

## Screenshots
The screenshots are from the first version of the application prior to submitting the project (So they might contain some irrelevant or funny text used for debugging purposes).

### Questionnaire
Standard questionnaires gathered from an authentic manual known as DSM-5.

### Progress Tracking
Idea was to show user his result and progress, and to ask questionnaries periodically to update progress.

### Exercises
Used SoundCloud API for audio and YouTube API for videos.

Just like group therapy, each forum containing categories, each category containing posts and then each post containing comments.
